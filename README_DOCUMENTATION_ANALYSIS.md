## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Read **DOCUMENTATION_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.txt** to understand:
- How many files need work (52 total, 6 well documented, 20+ need critical work)
- Which files are most critical (backtest.py, training/regressor.py, data_collector modules)
- Overall coverage (11.2% average - well below industry standards)

### Step 2: Deep Dive
Review **DOCUMENTATION_ANALYSIS_DETAILED.md** to:
- See specific issues in each priority file
- Understand what "well documented" looks like
- Identify patterns in what needs improvement
- Learn about outstanding TODO/FIXME items

### Step 3: Plan & Execute
Use **DOCUMENTATION_ACTION_PLAN.md** to:
- Create documentation standards (1 hour)
- Document critical files systematically (Tier 1: 10-12 hours)
- Add type hints (2-3 hours)
- Polish and review (2-3 hours)
- **Total effort:** 15-19 hours across 1-2 weeks

## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Issues

1. **Core System Components Undocumented** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - `backtest.py` (5.8%) - 1700+ line backtesting engine
   - `training/regressor.py` (4.0%) - ML training pipeline
   - `data_collector/fmp.py` (6.8%) - Data collection orchestration

2. **Data Pipeline Completely Undocumented**
   - `data_collector/fmp_api.py` (4.0%)
   - `data_collector/fmp_fetch_worker.py` (4.0%)
   - All 3 data_collector modules have <7% coverage

3. **Type Hints Missing Everywhere**
   - 20+ files with 0% type hint coverage
   - Critical files affected: backtest, regressor, all data_collector modules
   - Impacts: IDE autocompletion, static analysis, readability

4. **Outstanding Technical Debt**
   - 11 TODO/FIXME items across 5 files
   - backtest.py alone has 5 TODO + 1 FIXME
   - Should be resolved alongside documentation

### Files by Category

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Well Documented (18%+) | 6 | storage/parquet_storage.py, strategy/sector_ensemble.py |
| Reasonably Documented (10-17%) | 5 | main.py, config/logger.py |
| Poorly Documented (5-9%) | 3 | backtest.py, training/make_mldata.py |
| Not Documented (<5%) | 6 | data_collector/fmp_api.py, training/regressor.py |
| Scripts/Examples | 32 | Mostly acceptable |

## Priority Groups & Effort

### TIER 1: CRITICAL (Do First)
**Total Effort: 10-12 hours**

| File | Coverage | Effort | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| backtest.py | 5.8% | 3-4h | HIGHEST |
| training/regressor.py | 4.0% | 2-3h | HIGH |
| data_collector/fmp_api.py | 4.0% | 2-3h | HIGH |
| training/make_mldata.py | 5.6% | 2-3h | HIGH |
| data_collector/fmp.py | 6.8% | 1.5-2h | HIGH |
| storage/parquet_converter.py | 4.0% | 1-1.5h | MEDIUM |

### TIER 2: IMPORTANT (Do Next)
**Total Effort: 3-4 hours**

- main.py (add type hints)
- models/ensemble.py (improve type hints)
- config/context_loader.py (complete documentation)
- models/base_model.py (add type hints)

### TIER 3: NICE-TO-HAVE (Optional)
**Total Effort: 2-3 hours**

- config/logger.py (complete function docstrings)
- config/g_variables.py (add section comments)
- tools/rank_processing.py (add module docstring)

## Documentation Quality Breakdown

### What "Well Documented" Looks Like
Files scoring 18%+ (6 files):
- ✓ Module-level docstring explaining purpose
- ✓ All classes documented with purposes and key attributes
- ✓ All public methods have docstrings with Args/Returns/Raises
- ✓ Strong type hint coverage (70%+)
- ✓ Inline comments explain complex logic

**Examples:**
- `storage/parquet_storage.py` - Perfect documentation
- `feature_engineering/feature_selector.py` - 100% type hints
- `strategy/sector_ensemble.py` - Clear API design
- `training/optimizer.py` - Well-structured with examples

### What Needs Improvement
Files scoring <10% (9 files):
- ✗ Missing module-level docstring
- ✗ Classes completely undocumented
- ✗ Many methods missing docstrings
- ✗ 0% type hint coverage
- ⚠ Lots of inline comments but no proper docstrings

**Critical Examples:**
- `backtest.py` - 182 inline comments but 0 class docstrings
- `training/regressor.py` - 122 inline comments but no class/method docstrings
- `data_collector/fmp_api.py` - 0 docstrings, 0 type hints
